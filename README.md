## Overview  

This project analyzes sales performance, profit margins, and key business trends using the **Superstore dataset**.  
The objective is to design a **KPI dashboard** that highlights performance across regions, product categories, and customer segments, enabling data-driven decision-making.  

This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Clean, transform, and model raw data using **SQL Server**  
- Build and calculate KPIs (Revenue, Profit Margin, Growth Rate, etc.)  
- Visualize business insights interactively using **Power BI**  
- Communicate actionable findings clearly and effectively
